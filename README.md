## Development Setup for the Official Website

This website is the front-end part of the Altitude Learning Grade Calculator, a Chrome extension. The website is built using Create React App.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm must be installed on your machine.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

#### Starting the App

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Testing the App

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### Building the App for Production

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance, and the build is minified with filenames including the hashes.

### Customization

To modify the website, start by editing the React components in the `src` folder. Create React App has many built-in features that you can utilize.
